The functions of Arrays in Java’s purpose is to group multiple values that relate to one another in some way into a single variable.

The functions of Array Lists in Java has a similar purpose to a regular array in the way that they are also used to group multiple values that relate to one another into a single variable, but makes them different from a normal array is that the size of array list can be easily modified at any time while regular arrays in Java cannot be. 

Along with being able to easily dynamically change the size of Array List, some other conceptual differences between Arrays and Array Lists in Java included that “elements can be added and removed from an Array List whenever you want, but if you were to use a regular Array you would be forced to have to create a new Array each time if you wanted to add or remove elements to/from it,” (Java Array List). This means that Array lists have easily adaptability throughout the project and you don’t have to worry about going through a lot of work manually changing them all the time if you decide later on when your testing it you need to add or remove a preexisting variable in an Array list to make the program work as you intend it to. Also the “syntax when writing Array lists is different than for Arrays” so that is also something important to keep in mind as a major difference between them (Java Array List).  To sum it all up there are a couple major differences between using Arrays and Array lists Java which include Array lists can dynamically change size while regular arrays cannot, Array list are also easily modifiable compared to normal arrays, and also Array list and Arrays list use different syntax to one another so it’s an important fact to keep in mind to make sure you are using the right syntax depending on whether you want to use an array or array list in your program.
